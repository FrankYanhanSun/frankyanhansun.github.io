## Research & Internship
### 2026
### 2025
- Development of teleoperation hardware and software system for embodied AI (VLA). See our [LeRobot Anything UArm](https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/LeRobot-Anything-U-Arm/tree/main)<br>**An internship supervised by [Prof. Bo Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R3_AR5EAAAAJ&hl=en) in [SJTU@MINT](https://mint-sjtu.github.io/)**
- Research on trajectory planning and torque optimization of manipulator with HQP and RNN
- Simulation and experiment on soft robot<br>**(A summer research internship supervised by [Prof. Ke Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UOd1SfAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) in MBZUAI)**
- Object detection robotcar with ESP32s3 and K230<br>**(A university-level undergraduate innovation project)** 

### 2024
- Research on diagnosis and localization of moles for robotic mole removal surgery based on YOLOv8<br>**(A research experience supervised by [Prof. Hongliang Ren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en))**
- Research on receiving point cloud data acquired by LiDAR using UDP communication and line point cloud fitting method based on least squares and random sampling consistency algorithm (RANSAC), with the tools of Qt and Point Cloud Library (PCL) <br>**(An internship in Nanjing Taiside Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.)**
- Research on automatic labeling of sealing points in LDAR archived images based on YOLOv8<br>**(As the leader of the team)**
