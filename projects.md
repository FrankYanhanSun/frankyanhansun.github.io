## Early Projects
### 2025
- My Personal Website (the content will be continually updated)
<br>
### 2024
- Research on diagnosis and localization of moles for robotic mole removal surgery based on YOLOv8<br>**(A research experience under the guidance of [Prof Hongliang Ren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en) with a thesis mentioned above)**
- Research on receiving point cloud data acquired by LiDAR using UDP communication and line point cloud fitting method based on least squares and random sampling consistency algorithm (RANSAC), with the tools of Qt and Point Cloud Library (PCL) <br>**(An internship experience in Nanjing Taiside Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.)**
- Research on automatic labeling of sealing points in LDAR archived images based on YOLOv8<br>**(As the leader of the team)**
