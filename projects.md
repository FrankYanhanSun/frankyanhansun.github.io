# Projects
> Update: 14/04/2025

## Papers
- **Sun,Y**. (2024).<br>[Research on Diagnosis and Localization of Moles for Robotic Mole Removal Surgery Based on YOLO](https://doi.org/10.54254/2755-2721/111/2024CH0117).<br>Applied and Computational Engineering,111,105-113.

## Ongoing Projects
- Creation for a bluetooth gamepad for controlling everything (robots, games, etc.)
- Creation for an automatic target-seeking robot car<br>**(In charge of PCB design for the expanded board for the ESP32s3 minimum system board and for programming for motion control)**

## Early Projects
### 2025
- [Expanded board for ESP32s3 minimum system board](https://github.com/FrankYanhanSun/ESP32_Expanded_Board)
- [Design of USB hub](https://github.com/FrankYanhanSun/USBhub)<br>**(My first ever hardware project including PCB design and exterior modeling)**
- My Personal Website <br>**(the content will be continually updated)**

### 2024
- Research on diagnosis and localization of moles for robotic mole removal surgery based on YOLOv8<br>**(A research experience supervised by [Prof Hongliang Ren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en) with a paper mentioned above)**
- Research on receiving point cloud data acquired by LiDAR using UDP communication and line point cloud fitting method based on least squares and random sampling consistency algorithm (RANSAC), with the tools of Qt and Point Cloud Library (PCL) <br>**(An internship experience in Nanjing Taiside Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.)**
- Research on automatic labeling of sealing points in LDAR archived images based on YOLOv8<br>**(As the leader of the team)**
